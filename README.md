*Eriantys* is an Italian board game, for 2-4 players, created by Leo Colovini.
It is a game full of strategy and twists. Plan your moves carefully and try to control the moves of your opponents. With three different game modes, including a team game, Eriantys offers always different and interesting matches. Also, if you play with the expert variant, you can use the fantastic abilities of the special characters. *Manage your Eriantys’ school and compete with other wizards to increase your fame!*

The *target* of the projet is the implementation of a distributed system composed by a single server capable of managing one game at a time and multiple clients (one per player) that can participate in only one game at a time. The game has been implemented according to the architectural pattern MVC (Model-View-Controller) and a TCP network using sockets.
